# Photo-Merge
ðŸ“· Photo migration and management system

Will merge multiple drives with only photos onto one drive. The main reason that this is so great, it that it will also find duplicated and delete the lower quality version automatically. Below is how the photos are gonna be sorted on the new drive:

- Year
    - Month
        - Day
